# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. A major part of this project was to determine if there is any bias towards reviews that were written as part of the Vine program (paid) and reviews that were not part of the Vine program (unpaid).

Deliverables for this project:
..* total number of reviews (paid vs unpaid)
..* total number of 5-star reviews (paid vs unpaid)
..* percentage of 5-star reviews (paid vs unpaid)

## Results 
#### **Total number of paid reviews: 94**
#### **Total number of unpaid reviews: 40471**

## Summary 
After analysis, we learned that 51.1% of the reviews written by members of the Amazon Vine program were 5-Star reviews and that 38.7% of the reviews written by non-members were 5-Star reviews. It's very clear that there is positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. After all, it's hard to be upset after receiving free product!
